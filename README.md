# Python Programming 

In this lab, we will create and run a simple Python program. We will install a library, create a code file, save it, and edit it to make changes.

## Objectives

1. Install a python package using the terminal.
2. Create a simple Python program using bash.
3. Execute the program.
4. Edit the source code and re-run the program.

This hands-on lab is part of the course **Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask** within the **IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate**.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the lab:

1. **Install a Package Using Terminal**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Use `pip` to install the required library:
     ```bash
     pip install <library-name>
     ```

2. **Create a Simple Python Program Using Bash**:
   - In the terminal, create a new Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`):
     ```bash
     touch hello_world.py
     ```
   - Open the file in your IDE and write a simple Python program:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

3. **Execute the Program**:
   - Run the Python program using the terminal:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```

4. **Edit the Source Code and Re-run the Program**:
   - Make changes to the Python file (e.g., modify the print statement).
   - Save the changes and re-run the program to see the updated output:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
